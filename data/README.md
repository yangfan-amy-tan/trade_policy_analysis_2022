# Data

This part contains 5 data files we use for analysis in this paper. 

__1.__ _Final_dva_gtrade.dta_: Final merged dataset for econometric analysis. 

__2.__ _Gravity_selected.dta_: Selected gravity variables. 

__3.__ _rta_selected_bi.dta_: Selected trade agreement dummies.

__4.__ _dva_gtrade.dta_: Merged dataset of both dva and gtrade. 

__5.__ _exporter_list.dta_: List of countries included in analysis. 

_rta_20200520.dta_ is required in order to run _3_rta_gravity_select.do_ (see "codes"). We obtain the dataset of "all multilateral and bilateral regional trade agreements as notified to the World Trade Organization for the last 70 years from 1950 to 2019" from https://www.ewf.uni-bayreuth.de/de/forschung/RTA-daten/index.html (accessed Nov 2022). 

In order to run _3_rta_gravity_select.do_ (see "codes"), _Gravity_V202102.dta_ from http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=8 (accessed Nov 2022) is needed. "For any pair of countries, from 1948 to 2020, Gravity provides all the information required to estimate gravity equations: trade flows, geographical distances, trade facilitation measures, macroeconomic indicators, etc".
